### CPSC 120A

* 	 Lab 1 
 Lab 1 Part 1 was one of my favorite labs to work on. Although very simple, the hello world program was a great introduction to coding. It shows the beginning of coding and its possibilities. 

* 	Lab 3
	Lab 3 Part 1 was one of my favorite labs to work on because I thought it was cool how you could use math in coding. The simple BMR formula and the use of math and inputting so that the computer can code it was really interesting.

* 	Lab 7 Part 1 was one of my favorite labs to work on because of the complexity. Using coding and understanding the parking rules was interesting as you had to make sure that each parking street had different no parking times.
